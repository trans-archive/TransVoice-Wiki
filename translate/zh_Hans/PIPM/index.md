# 音高自然化
一种用于减少声音重量并达到更加可持续的，清晰的声门发音技巧的方法。

## 忘记你知道的一切
Forget singular aspects such as vocal weight, resonance etc. The more you focus on one aspect and try to achieve it, the less this method will work. Be patient! Sometimes results are vague and don’t feel like you have control but there are results regardless, and if we focus on individual aspects or try to do much at all then we won’t get results. Your conscious mind will ruin it, so instead, let your voice naturally and automatically adjust and naturalise. The only parts that are consciously controlled are the very beginning and the times we change pitch intentionally, the rest should be on autopilot.

## 工作原理
理想情况下，这种方法如何运作对学习者来说并不重要；倘若我们遵循练习规则，并按描述来完成，我们理应在不需要刻意进行调整的情况下就得到练习效果，且练习的效果本就需要避免刻意控制声音, 所以请以将这一部分作为背景知识来了解，否则请跳过：

工作原理十分简单。 我们的声音存在着复合性，或者说当你试图达到某个目的时，也会同时达成另一个目的。有时候这种复合性会影响我们, 但有时候也代表了某种层面上的自然平衡。 音高在声音女性化的几乎每个要点上都存在着少量的正向复合性， 且我们在不费力也不牺牲其他要点的前提下调节音高的能力代表了声音女性化与更广义的发声能力中非常关键的一项技能。通过这些方法习得的能力等效于在数年来通过每日的练习所取得的成果。

一旦学会，这些技能对任何音高都有帮助, 也就是说我们可以在较低的音高下维持女性化的声音特征以及我们通过这些方法习得的其他通用技能。需要格外注意的是音高本身对声音的“质量”以及性别影响甚微，却是可以用来达到我们想要的改变的有力工具。 我们的目标并非“提高音高”，而是在每种音高下改进声音。最终，我们可以获得在下意识中控制声音重量的能力，但这需要大量的练习。

## 目标
你的目标只是一种声音! 请致力于在 “这个声音是否与我的目标更相似”上努力。 物理上的不适感只在遇到收缩或受压迫等情况时发生，所以尽量减少物理动作；否则，我们会将这些感受当做一种反馈，并刻意促成这种感受，即使这会带来更多的紧绷感以及压缩感。 这种声音理应在物理感觉上与你未受训练的声音一致，除了对全身的振动有变。 个别要点在大部分时候不会造成影响，除非我们在排查一些具体的问题，所以最好忽略掉“声音重量”或是“共鸣”以及其他构成声音的要素。专心达成“清晰度”或是“自然化”等不那么具体的概念反而能让你的潜意识帮助你达成目标。 在声音训练上，你的潜意识比你的清醒意识要好用多了！



# Part One - Tone
In this we learn to achieve a basic voice coordination which has high pitch mobility, meaning we can modulate pitch without effort and without compromising other qualities we want in our voice such as clarity and volume. It doesn't necessarily make our voices significantly feminine yet, though some people find this is all they need to achieve a feminine voice. What it does do is provide a solid but flexible and stable coordination. What we learn in this process is what most people take years to develop: clear, stable and robust glottal behavior

声门行为指的仅仅是那些帮助发音的小技巧，如清晰度与明亮度。


## 练习

### Pitch Naturalisation using pitch "floating"
This is the main exercise, and should be the first one we do. It mostly preserves our speech patterns and clarity, while letting only the gendered aspects of our voice change.

The idea is to start speaking at whatever is your natural relaxed pitch, with a slightly louder voice if possible. Don't go breathy or quiet, keep it strong and natural. Speak a passage; let intonation be present, and make the last note of each phrase or sentence held longer so it's easier to tell what the pitch is doing. This will be your base pitch. The base pitch will now rise just slightly, so the pitch you end each phrase on will be slightly higher too. Once you feel **very comfortable** here, let that base pitch and the whole voice float up a little further, still letting the voice rise for intonation as well. Just the act of raising the last note will shift the entire voice, and the fact that we shifted the entire voice will mean the voice will slowly and naturally adjust. How high you go is determined by which pitches are already relaxed and naturalized.
- speak at your relaxed, not-doing-anything pitch
- make sure to start strong, possibly a little bit louder and heavier than normal
- make **the last word of each phrase held longer** and monotone as it rests on the **base pitch** which helps keep the base pitch consistent
- base pitch is the pitch your voice returns to after intonation, and it's what is raising the entire voice up to that "anchor"
- once you feel comfortable here, let that last word and note float up a tiny bit, raising the whole voice
- repeat, but don't push the pitch too high - the goal is to naturalize all of your range, not raise pitch
- be extremely patient; if you rush or try too hard to control things, it won't work
- lean toward less airflow but moderately loud
- going up in pitch should be extremely easy, suspiciously so; if not, spend more time letting it naturalise it here or start again
- pitch naturalisation is called that because at each pitch, the voice sounds natural as if it's always been at this pitch and this is your "natural voice"

### Pitch naturalisation at a set pitch
This is slightly more advanced, so it is best to use it only if we either get stuck on the floating method, or have already achieved some changes through that exercise. This can also be used to bring a lighter voice down low in pitch for deep feminine voices, once enough skill is learned.
- pick a pitch to use as a base pitch; make sure it's not too high, it should be easy to do in your heavier, more masculine voice
- slide up to this pitch and speak one phrase monotone, keeping it loud and strong
- start the second phrase a little higher, but have it come down to the base pitch again by the end, making it easier to add intonation
- at no point in this exercise should you 'try' to do anything, and it's best to avoid focusing on any individual aspects. Instead, is the overall voice getting more natural and easy to use?
- at each pitch step your goal is to become more lazy and relaxed over time and to get used to speaking at this level; your body wants to do certain things to the voice at each pitch and so you should let it.
- when you're very very comfortable and it feels natural and not 'pushed' to speak here, go to the next pitch or start again
- if you can let the intonation naturally go quite high, then you'll get a little more results faster but again don't 'try' to do so


# Part Two - Brightness
Brightness comes from many sources but the main source is that resonance and clarity interact to make a voice brighter. We can approach these things in a similar manner to the pitch naturalisation. If we get stuck, it may be necessary to do some basic [resonance](/wiki/pages/resonance) training just to get the ability to shift it at all first and then come back to this exercise, but it is worth attempting first. If you've gone through the previous exercises and naturalised your voice to F3 or above, then this is a good time to try this exercise.
### Dark to bright naturalisation
- start at a medium pitch with a deep, dark, yawn-like voice
- speak a passage and let it adjust, becoming brighter
- this means high resonance
- find a good balance for this
- if you find you have not enough range or don't get any changes, try the unvoiced and then the voiced resonance exercises
- make sure to start very very deep and low resonance, otherwise you will find it harder to make changes
- making changes slowly is better than having it jump suddenly
