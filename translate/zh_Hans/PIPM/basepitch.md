# 基础音高
当正常说话时，为了保持音调，嗓音会提高，而最后会降回来并反复停留在同一音高上。嗓音想要自然回到的音高称为基础音高，它主要由发声的轻重决定。 

较重的发声程度 --> 更低的音高
较轻的发声程度 --> 可以保持较高的基础音高

换句话说，基础音高便是在语调变化后声音会回归的那个原点。假如你将下列句子的最后一个字长读，你就能了解你目前的基础音高了（前提是你在“自然”地发声，而非刻意提高声音）。

## 音高的匹配与控制
如果你发现很难保持基本音高，那可能是因为你对音高没有太多的感知或控制。音高匹配是解决它的好办法，所以确保你在遇到困难时使用它。并不是每个人*在刚开始*都具备匹配和控制音高的能力，但几乎人人都能学会，并且通常学得很快。


## Exercises
As in [Pitch Naturalisation](/wiki/pages/PIPM), we can use base pitch to change parts of the voice, notably [vocal weight](/wiki/pages/vocal-weight). Below are some methods to change the base pitch.

### Intuitive base pitch
This is the main method for changing the base pitch. Importantly, it isn't tightly controlled or forced; we need the voice to naturally want to stay here, and forcing it to do so will not achieve that.
- base pitch is the pitch that you always come back down to after inflection / intonation; it's almost always the lowest note in speech
- play the note or hum the note of where you want to speak
- use a phrase that starts at the base pitch like "the north wind and the sun had a quarrel"
- the voice will immediately go up for intonation and that's a good thing
- when you intonate up and it starts coming down again, make sure it hits the base pitch
- the more "hesitant" it is to fall down, the less likely it is to drop below the intended base pitch, so it's good to bias the voice higher in pitch for the intonation
- gradually start to just speak naturally instead of control the pitch, but whenever your voice hits that base pitch, just notice that and draw attention to it
- likewise pay attention to if your voice drops below the base pitch
- you can also draw out the base pitch note longer if you need to (e.g. on "quarrel"), but prioritise just noticing it passively
- eventually you'll memorise and keep the base pitch subconsciously without needing to drill for it

### Singing base pitch (contrived)
This more or less "forces" a base pitch if you have trouble with the more intuitive methods. Keep in mind if the pitch is too high it will be straining and achieve nothing, so only use this for getting used to controlling the base pitch at all, not for doing a higher and higher pitch.
- pick a pitch, and some other pitch that is a bit higher
- say "one" at the high one, and "two" at the low one, as if singing those notes
- say some phrase like `?crate` or `?northwind`, where it starts at the high note, and only at the very end comes down to the low note
- e.g. "**[high]** open the crate but don't break the **[low]** glass"
- this is very contrived of course but it can be made more natural by doing less of the "singing" quality
