# Creak
Creak, sometimes called [fry](/wiki/pages/other-resources/mechanisms.html#m0) is a similar sounding rough, a-periodic noise. It happens when we have too much closure for the amount of airflow, and so the folds don't vibrate in a periodic wave, being interrupted occasionally.

You can see it pretty clearly on a spectrogram. Notice the noise and roughness:

Example of a very creaky voice:

Creak and fry (M0) are distinct in practice (though they are thought to possibly be the same by some)
- creak can be at any pitch and is caused primarily by airflow dynamics
- fry is always at the bottom of the vocal range (though it can be coerced higher) and airflow mostly doesn't matter

## Common places to see creak
Creak is a fairly common part of female speech patterns. It isn't in itself gendered of course. Some accents (see: valley girl) have more creak in them.

## Issues with Creak
While creak is pretty normal it can be annoying to not be able to get rid of it. Since it's airflow based, adding a slight amount of air and making airflow more consistent especially at the end of phrases, can help. [SOVTEs](/wiki/pages/other-resources/SOVTE) can help with this to some extent, particularly lip trills.

# Exercises
## Lip Trills
Lip trills require balanced airflow, which means we can use this to get a consistent airflow habit and therefore avoid creak.

Madeline Harvey's video covers this. The lip trills are at 4:38 but the breath support information in the beginning is very useful too for airflow consistency.
